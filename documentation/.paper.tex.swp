\emph{\textbf{	The project  Lightweight Dynamic Memory Manager, is a memory manager implemented with the programing  language c++, the final goal for this project, is create a functional manager of simulated virtual memory, it can be used for emulate any program that have the correct implementation of this program.
It could be possible by overloading operators, thats are normally used, and using principal the malloc function, to get the chunk for simulate the memory, where there be allocated the cases and process we make using abstraction of pointer to refer those an allocated them.
The final result is a functional memory manager that allow the use or simulated virtual memory, with two chunks of memory, one for allocate, and one for keep registry of all that is allocated; another important thing is the possibility  to make paging, like real virtual memory, and give the possibility to emulate more objects and more expensive.\\\\}}
\textbf{key words: }overloading, malloc, allocated, paging.
